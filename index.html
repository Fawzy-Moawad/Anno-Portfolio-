                My journey in contemporary dance has been fueled by a deep passion for movement and artistic expression. Over the past 13 years, I've performed on various stages, honing my skills and exploring innovative approaches to dance. Now, as I continue my professional training in New York and pursue new opportunities , I aim to push the boundaries of contemporary dance and share my evolving artistry with diverse audiences.

            <p>With a rich background in contemporary dance, I have had the privilege of performing in numerous shows across Egypt and New York. Each performance reflects a journey of exploration and growth, allowing me to connect with audiences and convey powerful stories through movement.

                  Three passionate dancers/choreographers who came to the Unites States 
                  pursing freedom of expression. We as artists turn the adversities of our 
                  personal experiences into choreographic work that seeks to generate 
                  awareness for the voices that continued to live in silence and oppression 
                  in many countries around the world.

                  The 2011 Egyptian revolution had a profound impact on me and many 
                  others around m e, in a way that cannot be shaken off even if we 
                  tried. Graffiti, just like many aspects around the revolution, exploded 
                  and spread, colors blossoming around the city with each day of those 
                  revolution years; then dwindled down, then got painted over leaving us 
                  with these polluted soul-less grey walls again as the come back of the 
                  authoritarian regime gained its strength, brushing aside all those events 
                  that changed our lives, as if they never happened.

                  This performance does not only address geographical boundaries. This 
                  performance addresses those boundaries we create ourselves 
                  unintentionally; those boundaries we frame our lives with, we frame our 
                  jokes, our talks, our thoughts. Those boundaries inhibit our values and 
                  daily routines. 
                  Society also set its own boundaries upon our humanity, they breathe 
                  through custom and traditions till it reaches our house-rules. Authorities 
                  have their share of regulating impositions with their authoritarian laws.
                  This performance portrays how each one of us undergo the same human 
                  experience with different scenarios and contexts. We try to uproot those 
                  boundaries, we confront others, struggle together. Yet we live and die in 
                  this vicious circle.

                  We grow up studying: Subject+Verb+Object. We were asked to make 
                  sure we know how to deconstruct sentence structures. It became an 
                  innate skill to piece any sentence we encounter, however, we never 
                  speculated our actions the same way; when we are the actors, how we 
                  can be the acting, and sometimes even acted upon. We are the three, 
                  happening at random times.

                  In our young years, we have been taught to submit. We have submitted 
                  to our parents unconditionally. We have submitted to educational 
                  systems and the likes. Personally, I never fathomed submitting to the 
                  Wrong.
                  Prophecy, it is commonly known as “planning”, we tailor our days with 
                  “I will..”, “In an hour, I will..”. This performance is about how we 
                  submit and foresee

                  This performance paints suicide and the moments before it is committed. 
                  It takes a look at this experience’s contradictions, you are strong the 
                  moment you make the decision, yet you are weak for escaping reality. 
                  This performance takes place in the main character’s bedroom, which 
                  accommodates his every little detail; the messiness, the memories. 
                  I attempted suicide once and I failed. Mounir, my friend who stopped me 
                  was the one who choreographed this performance, and set it up together

                  In ancient Egypt, GEB is the god of the Earth. This performance we 
                  ponder upon women and their marginalization. We dance for women 
                  with limited access to culture, art, society and politics. We attempted 
                  through this performance to show how women were celebrated in the 
                  past, and why the should continue to be celebrated; because they are in 
                  essence they are the reason we are here. We come to this world and the 
                  first thing we do is careless about them. We aim at controlling them, not 
                  coexisting.

                  This street-performance choreographed by Stopgap. Bringing together a 
                  diverse group putting the daily lives of marginalized groups, mentally 
                  challenged and people with disabilities at the heart of our performance, 
                  in an invitation to perceive and interact with marginalized people beyond 
                  limiting standardized ableism. There is a number of sequences 
                  demonstrating romance, friendship and passion with no regard to 
                  physical capabilities. This performance is my latest and it comes as one 
                  of my favorite for its consensual invitation for coexistence and tolerance.
